3,"A break in the series occurs with the release of the 2010 data due to an improvement in the method used to assign vehicle type. At the national level, the main impact of this change was a net increase in the number of vehicles weighing 15 tonnes and more and a net decrease in the number of vehicles weighing from 4.5 tonnes to less than 15 tonnes. The impacts vary considerably by province and territory."
